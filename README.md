## Description
The impact of suicide goes beyond the actual death. Suicide deaths and attempts have a significant impact on family members and friends, who are often left with a number of unanswered questions in addition to the loss of a loved one. There is also the aspect of ecomonic loss from suicide where there is: lost productivity of the loved onesâ€™ grieving a suicide, lost wages of those who have committed suicide, medical expenses of emergency intervention and non-emergency treatment for suicidality.
Knowing the risk factors and recognizing the warning signs for suicide can help prevent suicide. The following are examples of the signs to look out for; excessive drug or alcohol use or abuse, previous personal suicide attempt, self-harm, aggressive/impulsive behaviours, loss of interest, despair and hopelessness especially if it is related to a painful event like grief, job loss, or change. 
Therefore, given a series of observations over time (tweets), the task is to detect the contents of the tweets that may be considered as a suicide warning sign.
